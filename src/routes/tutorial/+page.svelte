    For this cloud storage to work, you are required to have a Discord and Google account. If you do not have those, please create them before continuing.
    If you have your accounts, please open Discord and create a new server. Then open the settings for a text channel and go to integration. There you will have the option to create a new WebHook. Please do so and click on the WebHook, to access the WebHook-URL, you will need this later.
    Now go to discloud-neon.vercel.app and log in with your Google account. If this is the first time logging in, you will be asked to insert a WebHook-URL, here you paste the URL from step 2.
    Your Discloud is now ready
